      <h2>Data Retreival Methods</h2>
      <dl>
	<dt>Poll - <a href="#poll" id="poll" class="method">Use this method</a> (default)</dt>
	<dd>
	  In this method the server polls FreeSWITCH for the entire channel list once per second. And
	  then will emit that full list tot he client via websockets. This causes a full redraw of the
	  table, and for the server to buffer the list. This method is the least efficient, but is the
	  quickest and least complex.
	</dd>

	<dt>Live - <a href="#live" id="live" class="method">Use this method</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  In this method the server listens to ESL events and sends row updates to the client,
	  unfortunately this will not detect channels that existed before you started listening. Only
	  channels that are created after listening are displayed. The benefit is that the server does not
	  have to buffer a channel list, and the client only has to update rows that change. Unfortunately
	  it increases complexity and introduces a problem where a message can be missed and the client
	  can be out of date. Note: Although this method requires no server buffer, this implementation
	  does buffer a channel list based on events from this method. However, to simulate an unbuffered
	  server if you switch to this method, the entire list is not sent down as a refresh.
	</dd>

	<dt>Hybrid - <a href="#hybrid" id="hybrid" class="method">Use this method</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  In this method the server tries to combine both. It initially fills a buffers a full channel list
	  from FreeSWITCH using "show channels as json". Then, it subscribes to events for new events. When
	  the websocket initially connects it gets a full list of the buffer, then as events come in it is
	  notified of changes to rows. In this way you get the benefits of both: lightweight messaging, but
	  access tot he full list.
